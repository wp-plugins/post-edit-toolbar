Adds a pair of dropdowns 'Page list' and 'Post List' to the WordPress toolbar of the most recently edited pages, drafts, future schedules pages + posts.

== Description ==

Adds a pair of dropdowns 'Page list' and 'Post List' to the WordPress toolbar of the most recently edited pages, drafts, future schedules pages + posts. This provides you quick access to a work in progress, or a page/post that was recently published.

The new menus work as 'post quick edit' and 'page quick edit' shortcut menus - not forgetting 'drafts quick edit'.  The quick edit menus will allow you to access your recently used pages, posts, drafts and even your scheduled posts + pages in less clicks than first visting the posts page or pages page.

This plugin is designed for publishers who get interrupted while composing those posts (if you're anything like me - almost every post/page is interrupted, or composed and then saved as a draft before final publishing!

Currently this plugin displays a separate menu for page drafts, scheduled page + published pages, plus a second menu for your most recent draft posts, scheduled posts and 5 most recent published posts.

If you use WordPress admin (not the app) on your laptop or tablet (such as iPad) - you will probably find this plugin very useful.

== Installation ===

1. Upload `post-edit-toolbar.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. A pair of dropdown menus will appear in the WordPress toolbar titled 'Page List' and 'Post List'.

== Screenshots ==

1. The dropdown shows the add new Page, Drafts, Scheduled Pages + the 2 most recently edited pages.
2. This dropdown shows the add new post, a future scheduled post and the most recently published post - which in this case is the 'Hello World!' post.
